Grandlead heritage is a spin off of practical bullshtako (bullshit). Imagine them starting off with questions of technical knowledge, customer service, logistics and customer management, then you see people bowing thinking hard to find answers to those questions.

Pens up, Up next, video presentations of fashola and few entrepreneurs. As that was not enough...then a dude with a big attitude waltz in after being invited on stage. 

This gentleman started and few people stood up and waltz out like a boss they are. And so, the pep talk started, the gentleman made me remember all my experience with GNLD folks, wasting my tfare and time. 

I remained, smiled at the individual, then he started bragging about his qualifications and all. His sugar coated mouth began, explaining his backup plan, contingency plan and retirement plans. 

He said and I quote ""I want to retire by age 30"" having a landed property in ikorodu and begin tenancy.. I began to wonder how does this information help us discern the job specification. 

I was invited for graduate trainee position, and others were invited for other positions by different referrals. 

I left, then a friend on nairaland whom I met there prior to our communications and meet up plans in the previous day, told me they requested for money, which became clear that this individuals are looking for loyal, daft, jobfull people to feel their pockets for training kits and begin marketing jobs. 

So tell me isn't this GNLD!!!!!!!or what ever they discribe themselves as. 

So I drew my conclusion as tfare wasted, time wasted = non-fruitful endeavor = useless COY. Ignore their SMS or emails and search for other jobs. They even have a shitty website with no specificity as they also post jobs of other firms.

Greetings from Lagos.pls help me share cos I know most of your followers are here in Lagos. its God that
saved me yesterday.I applied for a job via Jiji on Monday, on Wednesday I was called for interview in Maryland Lagos.I got to Maryland took a bike to the location for the interview. When I got to the lonely building in mende there in Maryland, Okada dropped me and left, no one to ask a question, I called the number that was attached to the message of interview to tell him I'm at the venue, he picked and said his men are downstairs, I looked around and saw two men, the looks on their faces was not funny.They asked me to open the message for them to see, I opened it, after Reading they said I belong to room one, that I should switch off my phone b4 climbing the stairs, I told them I'm not expecting any call, they said its compulsory.I asked them how long the interview will last and they said 3 to 4hrs, I was tired. I told them to give me a minute let me inform my pple that I won't be home early as I told them, l went towards the gate to call my sister, as I was answering the call two men came down making them four, they started shouting on me that I'm wasting their time that is like I'm not ready for the job.As this was happening a guy from no where came behind me all I heard was ""my case is different ""and I said so is mine.

He said he saw the winners bangle I was wearing that I should meet him outside the gate. I followed him, he asked what brought me here, I told him I came for an interview, he said I should thank my God that I saw him if not it will be a different story by evening.That I should leave the place immediately that the pple are using charms on pple. I thanked him and entered a bike that dropped one guy at the gate there and left. They called and called I no pick.This morning they sent a text that my interview has been rescheduled.Lets be vigilant with online Jobs I have not been myself since yesterday.) Incase u get a text message like this..

The rude ladies there told us no talking, no laughing and that if you're not comfortable with that you should take your leave Like we were in a WAEC hall undecided. Very hungry looking ladies with rude attitude, one was even looking like a house girl with 'my madam dash me' kind of cloth grin grin grin. After sitting for like thirty minutes, one aggressive dude came out and was giving lecture o saying that DPearl is a group of companies, group of companies that doesn't even have a website o, telling us we have been chosen and are going to meet with his BDM  undecided undecided stories that touch the arsehole. He said we were going to have a two hour assessment, immediately I heard that, I carried my bag, packed my slippers and left. I took another applicant's number and asked him because he decided to wait till the end of the whole thing, he said all they did was brain wash people like those GNLD companies.
I went there just to see what they were up to because after I got their invite I went online to check for them, I only saw them on vconnect, no website, no specific service that they render. 
If you get anything from them, whether you applied or not, don't waste your transport fare biko, they are time wasters and scammers.
